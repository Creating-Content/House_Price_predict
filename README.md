# House_Price_predict
In this project, we'll predict future house prices. We'll use data from the Federal Reserve, along with house price data from Zillow. We'll merge and combine this data, then use it to train a random forest model. The model will predict if house prices will increase or decrease in the future. We'll measure error using backtesting.
